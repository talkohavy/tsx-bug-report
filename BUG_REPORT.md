# Debugger Step-Into (F11) Not Working with `node:async_hooks` in tsx

## 1. Summary

When debugging TypeScript files with tsx in VS Code, the debugger's "Step Into" (F11) functionality fails to work correctly when `node:async_hooks` is imported and used, even if the hook is not actively doing anything. The debugger steps over async function calls instead of stepping into them.

**Expected Behavior**: When pressing F11 (Step Into) on line 15 (`await stepIntoMe();`), the debugger should step into the `stepIntoMe()` function.

**Actual Behavior**: When pressing F11 (Step Into) on line 15 (`await stepIntoMe();`), the debugger steps over the function call instead of stepping into it.

## 2. Steps to reproduce:

1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Open the project in VS Code
3. Set a breakpoint on line 15: `await stepIntoMe();`
4. Start debugging with `npm run dev` (Simplest way to do this is by opening a `Javascript Debug Terminal`)
5. When the breakpoint is hit, press F11 (Step Into)
6. **Observe**: The debugger steps over the function instead of stepping into it

## 3. Workaround verification:

1.  Comment out line 10: `asyncHook.enable();`
2.  Repeat steps 4-5
3.  **Observe**: Step Into (F11) now works correctly

## 4. Additional Testing

### Test 1: Compiled JavaScript works correctly

When the TypeScript file is compiled to JavaScript using `tsc` and run with sourcemaps:

```bash
npm run build
node dist/index.js
```

The Step Into functionality works correctly, even with `node:async_hooks` enabled.

### Test 2: ESM JavaScript works correctly

When converting the file to ESM JavaScript (changing extension to `.js` and running directly):

```bash
node src/initServer.js
```

The Step Into functionality works correctly.

## 5. Impact

This bug significantly impacts the debugging experience for developers using tsx with any code that utilizes Node.js async_hooks, making it difficult to debug async function calls in such scenarios.
